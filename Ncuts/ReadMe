% Written & tested On Matlab (due to kmeans buildin usage) 
% In case one needs to run on octave, an external package with kmeans is required.

*** Ncuts folder includes Spectral-Clustering & Normalized Cuts Clustering ***

Clustering Basics:
* Assume an M x N x C image (M rows, N columns, C chromatic channels).
  Each pixel represents a vector/sample in R^C. The samples are reshaped from an M x N x C array to an (M * N) x C format.
    
----- Functions & Files -----

(A) Spectral Clustering

    (A.1) Image2Graph --> Provides an affinity matrix (M*N) x (M*N) of the pixel-samples. 
            (input: the desired image)
    
    (A.2) mySpectralClustering --> Performs Spectral Clustering 
            (input1: anAffinityMatrix, input2: number of desired clusters)

(B) Normalized Cuts Clustering

    (B.1) calculateNcut --> Calculates Ncuts metric. Used as a criterion to further cut the base-parent graph
                            into two derived-children graphs.
            (input1: the affinity matrix of the image, input2: the cluster labels of the image samples)
            
    (B.2) recursiveNcuts --> Performs recursive Ncuts algorithm (you must provide thresholds for max ncut value,
                                                                 min number of node-graphs)
            (input: the affinity matrix of the image)
            
    (B.3) adaptiveRecursiveNcuts --> My variation of recursiveNcuts (no need to provide thresholds).
                                     The algorithm uses a greedy approach to the n-cuts algorithm.
                                     ncuts threshold in (B.2) is adapted based on the father graph ncuts value.
