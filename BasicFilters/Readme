-- BasicFilters folder contains octave functions for all elementary frequency domain filters found in any DIP textbook -- 

* This type of filtering is applied directly on the frequency domain of the input image thus leading to ringing effects.

* Directional Filter functions are also provided.

* Running in matlab will cause errors due to matrix indexing.
  e.g: size(A)(1) is allowed in octave but not in matlab.
  The basic algorithm is the same though.
