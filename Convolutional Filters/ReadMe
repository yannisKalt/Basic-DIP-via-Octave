-- Convolutional Mask Filtering: Both Via spatial convolution && DFT Equivalent -- 

(1) myConvSpat.m
    Provides an implementation of the 2-d convolution between two 2-D finite extend sequences.
    Offered only for the sake of it.. Pretty slow.

(2)
  2-D convolution via FFT.
  
(3) myFilter.m
  Performs the 2-d convolution of it's inputs
  
(4)myMotBlur
  Motion Blurring Filtering.
  Performs Motion Blurring characterized by (mot_vec, exposure_time) to the input image.
  Better results than buildin octave function
